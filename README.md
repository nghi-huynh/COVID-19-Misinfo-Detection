**Tech Stack**: Python, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

COVID-19 virus has rapidly spread around the world and affected lots of peoplesâ€™ lives. Unfortunately, the diffusion of misinformation related to COVID-19 also gets created and propagates wildly on social media and other platforms. In this project, we built a modified LSTM with one layer and two layers to detect those fake news.
